      <h1> REQUIRED PARTS</h1>
      <br>
      <h2> A Quick Checklist before we go into details</h2>

      </ul>
      <h2 id="CPU"> CPU + Cooler: </h2>
      <p> The CPU is the brains of the computer. This is weather all of the processing of the computer happends.
        This part should be selected for your indivisual needs. Such as a gaming computer might need a processor with a
        higher clock speed(GhZ). Most CPU's come with a cooler but there are many third party cooler such as a water
        cooler
        which will keep your cpu cooler which is good when it comes to effiency.
      </p>
      <br id="mother">
      <h2> Motherboard: </h2>
      <p> While the processing happends in the CPU, the motherboard is where all the parts connect. The RAM, GPU, CPU,
        Fans, Lights, and
        anything that needs power is plugged into the motherboard.
      </p>
      <br id="Memory">
      <h2> Memory: </h2>
      <p> The Memory or RAM(Random Access Memory) is where applications are ran. Gaming computers or machines needed
        for
        video editing or other powerful applications may need 16- 32gb of RAM. For most people 4-8gb will suffice.
      </p>
      <br id="Storage">
      <h2> Storage: </h2>
      <p> Storage is where all of your data is stores. Here you have two options. One is an SSD(Solid State Drive). A
        SSD
        is
        much faster than any other storage means because it has no moving parts. Games and Apps and Files will open,
        run,
        and move faster
        on an SSD. On an SSD, the OS will be much faster. Unless you have a reason for no SSD, it is almost a
        requirement. The other option
        is a HDD(Hard Drive). A Hard Drive uses mechinical parts to store data which makes it slower. These are mostly
        used for backing up data These
        days so it is not really a requirement unless it is you only storage or you need data backed up.
      </p>
      <br id="graphics">
      <h2> Video Card: </h2>
      <p> The Video Card or GPU is where graphics are processed. This is the most important part in a gaming PC or
        video
        editing PC as
        this is where games and videos are rendered and displayed. Most games require at least 4gb of video memory so I
        would suggest
        getting 4gb or go for 8+ if you want high frame rates and ultra graphics settings.
      </p>
      <img src="Images/graphicscards.jpg" alt="Graphics Cards">
      <br id="case">
      <h2> Case</h2>
      <p> The Case is where all of the components are housed. Looks are important here as this will be what you look at
        when your PC is running. Cases usually include the fans so be sure to buy one that focuses on silence if you
        want
        that.
      </p>
      <br id="power">
      <h2> Power Supplies</h2>
      <p> Power Supplies is how the motherboard and all other components get power to run.</p>
      <br id="os">
      <h2> OS</h2>
      <p> THis is how the PC will respond to you. Usually people use Windows when building a PC due to easy of access
        and
        popularity and game support. But becuase you built the PC, you get to decide. It could be Windows but you could
        also choose
        Linix perhaps.
      </p>
      <br id="mon">
      <h2> Monitor</h2>
      <p> THis is where the computer displays images. This may be one of the more important components of the build.
        When
        choosing a
        monitor it is important to think about the quality of your parts and decide the framerate of the monitor and
        the
        resolution. 1080p and 60hz is the recommend but if you have the right parts and money you could expand to a 4k,
        244hz
        monitor.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h1> Optional Parts</h1>
      <br>
      <h2> Light Controller + Lights</h2>
      <p> if you would like to add a little light such as RGB controllable lights or just static ones, you can buy
        those.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2> Fan Controller + Extra Fans</h2>
      <p> Extra fans can come in handy if you have components that use a lot of power therefore generating much heat so
        you have to keep it cool.
        these fans will be keeping the case cool so you could even choose light up fans if you wanted.
      </p>

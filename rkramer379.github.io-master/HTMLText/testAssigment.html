      Before we start let me tell you a little about myslef
      This is the 1<sup>st</sup> time that I have taught this course. I was born at a very young age and grew in wisdom
      and grace until now. Of course, I hope to contintue to grow in both wisdom and grace but that will require effort and attention to what is happening
      in the world and in myslef. I hope you learn a lot about web programmming and are enlightended by what we do in the class. Good luck!

      When writing web pages you need to make sure that you are attentive to lots of details like the strucuture and formating of the page. I want to <em>emphasize</em> to you the importance of this.

            It is very important to be aware of all the small details when writing web pages. Afterall, small details can make a big difference.
            Be conscious of what you are learning and why you are learning it. We will certainly learn a lot in this class but we must always exert effort to learn

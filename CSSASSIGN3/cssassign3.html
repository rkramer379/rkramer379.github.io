      <p> I would like to visit these six places that i have in images above for the following reasons.
          I want to see mount everest beacuse it is the tallest mountain on earth. I would like to see
          the london eye because it is a really big ferris wheel. I would also Like
          to ride the ferris wheel and see London from high up.  I would also like to seethe Great Wall of
          China becuase it is a historical icon and a feat of human engineering. The great wall of
          China also had a lot of history behind it and history is one of my favorite subjects. I would like to see the One
          World Trade Center because it is the largest skyscraper in the westren hemisphere. I would also like to
          See New York while i am there becuase it is the largest city in America. The Pyramids would
          be cool to see becuase it is the last ancient wonder of the world remianing. Also they
          symbolize the ingenuity of human engieering in the ancient times. and then i would Like
          to see the washington Monument because it is one of the monuments in washington D.C. that is why
          i would like to visit the places above.

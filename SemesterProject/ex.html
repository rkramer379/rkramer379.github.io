               <p class="subtitle"> When and where did the first civilizations emerge? </p>
               <p> The first civilizations emerged around 3500 B.C.E. to 3000 B.C.E. The three civilizations that emerged were the Mesopotamians, the Egyptians, and the Norte Chico civilizations.</p>
               <p class="subtitle"> What accounts for the initial breakthroughs to civilization?</p>
               <p> Agricultural Revolutions allowed communities to produce food that would support large populations. This allowed for the development of technology like reading and writing. This gave civilizations an advantage over gather hunters.</p>
               <p class="subtitle"> In what ways was social inequality expressed in early civilizations?</p>
               <p> Social inequality was expressed in many early civilizations. For example, the early Mesopotamians were subdivided into different categories. Social inequality was expressed through class, hunting and agriculture, technology, and etc. This caused the upper class to be treated better. A free-born commoner were punished if they stuck a man higher than himself.</p>
               <p class="subtitle">In what ways have historians tried to explain the origins of patriarchy? </p>
               <p>Gender roles were very common in early civilizations. Men went and did the hard work in the family. They were allowed to have multiple wives and they can control all of them. The women had roles that were easy and most of the times indoors. They were only in control for cleaning, cooking, and having children. The book says most of the time the women were pregnant, trying to increase population. They could not do "manly" work while pregnant. </p>
               <p class="subtitle">How did Mesopotamian and Egyptian patriarchy differ from each other? </p>
               <p>Mesopotamians and Egyptians viewed women very differently. In Mesopotamian civilizations, men were in control of the women. Women who were married must wear a veil. Women who were slaves or prostitutes would not wear a veil. Egyptians allowed women to make major decisions for themselves and others. They could sign their marriage and divorce papers and they did not have to wear a veil. </p>
               <p class="subtitle">What were the sources of state authority in the First Civilization? </p>
               <p> The state solved many problems in the First Civilizations. They organized the irrigation systems of the river valley civilizations. They defended the city/territory against aggressive outsiders. They also broke up fights and conflicts that people caused.</p>
               <p class="subtitle">In what ways did Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations differ from each other? </p>
               <p> Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations are very different from each other. Although both civilizations rivers flooded, the Egyptians could predict when the Nile river would flood. This prevented their crops from being destroyed. However the Mesopotamians would not predict the floods. The Egyptians were protected from invasion, while the Mesopotamians were not, The Mesopotamians had strict rules for the women as Egyptian women had more control. Cities in Egypt were not very important while they were to the Mesopotamians.</p>
               <p class="subtitle">In what ways were the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations shaped by their interactions with near and distant neighbors? </p>
               <p> The Egyptian agriculture drew upon wheat and barely. The Egyptians received wheat and barely from the Mesopotamia. They also received domesticated donkeys, cattle, and watermelons. The Hitties influenced both Egypt and Mesopotamia by bringing domesticated horses, carts with wheels, and technology.</p>

            <div class="hidden" id="div3">
               <p class="subtitle"> How did the Persian and Greek civilizations differ in their political organization and values?</p>
               <p> Persia - built an imperial political system based on Mesopotamian policies (including Babylonian and Assyrian empires), was HUGE (30-50 million people), centered on kingship, rulers had absolute power and had divine kingship by the god Ahura Mazda, respected other cultural traditions 
                  Greek - no empire but had small colonies around the Mediterranean and Black Seas, popular participation (started with wealthy men and then trickled down to lower classes), Athenian democracy, (women, slaves, and foreigners could not participate)
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle"> How did semi democratic governments emerge in some of the Greek city-states?</p>
               <p>growing numbers of me purchase armor and weapons that allowed them to serve in the armies, tyrants would gather lower class followers and break the hold of power
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle"> What were the consequences for both sides of the encounter between the Persians and the Greeks?</p>
               <p> although Persia lost these wars had very little impact on their empire, the Greeks gained great pride for their win, their victory radicalized Athenian democracy (people in battle had to be replaced in the empire by lower class people), the 50 years following these wars was the zenith of Greece (parthenon was built, theatre was born, socrates began his career), led to an era of an incipient empire, led to Peloponnesian wars (Athens vs. Sparta), focus on the forces within Greece led to their immunity to be take over</p>
               <p class="subtitle"> What changes did Alexander's conquests bring in their wake?</p>
               <p> widespread dissemination of Greek culture into Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India (able to occur because of the many cities established by the Greeks throughout the Hellenistic era)</p>
               <p class="subtitle"> How did Rome grow from a single city to the center of a huge empire?</p>
               <p> the values of the Roman republic provided a basis (rule of law, the rights of citizens, absence of pretension, upright moral behavior, keeping one's word, protection of lower classes)
                  Victory in the Punic Wars with Carthage (264-146 BCE) extended Roman control over the western Mediterranean and made Rome a naval power
                  Poor soldiers hoped for land, loot, or salaries.
                  Rome's army was a key to its success
                  Known for being well trained, well fed, and and well rewarded
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle"> Why were Roman and Chinese empires able to enjoy long periods of relative stability and prosperity?</p>
               <p> relied on powerful armies, created effective systems of government, sophisticated bureaucracy, law applicable to all subjects, invested heavily in public works to integrate their empires militarily and commercially, both had directly sanctioned authority</p>
               <p class="subtitle"> What internal and external factors contributed to the collapse of Rome and China?</p>
               <p> INTERNAL: too overextended and expensive for available resources, didn't foster technological breakthrough to enlarge resources, suffered from tax evasion by large landowning families (then taxes fell to lower classes), rivalry between elite factions (leading to instability), suffered from epidemics
                  EXTERNAL: nomadic agricultural people occupying the frontier regions of both empires became growing threats that ultimately conquered portion of both empires (Rome - germanic speaking peoples) (China - yellow turban rebellion)
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle"> Why were central empires so much less prominent in India than in China?</p>
               <p> didn't have the kind loyalty or exercise to the degree of influence like China, India's unparalleled cultural diversity made a centralized empire less easy to construct than a more culturally united China, Indian state were smashed by invaders, caste system link to occupational groups making for intensely local loyalties at the expense of wider identities that might have fostered empires</p>

                  • Merchant leaders of the new Islamic community wanted to capture profitable trade routes and wealthy agricultural regions.
                  • Individual Arabs found in military expansion a route to wealth and social promotion.
                  • Expansion provided a common task for the Arab community, which reinforced the fragile unity of the umma.
                  • Arabs were motivated by a religious dimension, as many viewed the mission of empire in terms of jihad, bringing righteous government to the peoples they conquered.
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle">What accounts for the widespread conversion to Islam? </p>
               <p> • Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians could find familiar elements of their own faiths in Islam.
                  • From the start, Islam was associated with the sponsorship of a powerful state.
                  • Conquest called into question the power of old gods, while the growing prestige of the Arab Empire attracted many to Allah.
                  • Although forced conversion was rare, living in an Islamic-governed state provided a variety of incentives for claiming Muslim identity.
                  • In Islam, merchants found a religion friendly to commerce, and in the Arab Empire they enjoyed a huge and secure arena for trade.
                  • People aspiring to official positions found conversion to Islam an aid to social mobility.
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle">What is the difference between Sunni and Shia Islam? </p>
               <p> • Sunnis held that the caliphs were rightful political and military leaders, selected by the Islamic community, while the Shia held that leadership in the Islamic world should derive from the line of Ali and his son Husayn, blood relatives of Muhammad.
                  • For Sunni Muslims, religious authority in general emerged from the larger community, particularly from the religious scholars known as ulama. Meanwhile, the Shia invested their leaders, known as imams, with a religious authority that the caliphs lacked, allowing them alone to reveal the true meaning of the Quran and the wishes of Allah.
                  • The Shia tradition included a messianic element that the Sunni tradition largely lacked.
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle">In what ways were Sufi Muslims critical of mainstream Islam? </p>
               <p>• Sufism was sharply critical of the more scholarly and legalistic practitioners of the sharia; to Sufis, establishment teachings about the law and correct behavior did little to bring the believer into the presence of God.
                  • Sufis held that many of the ulama of mainstream Islam had been compromised by their association with worldly and corrupt governments. 
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle">How did the rise of Islam change the lives of women? </p>
               <p> • The Quran included a mix of rights, restrictions, and protections for women. It banned female infanticide, gave women the right to own property and granted them rights of inheritance, defined marriage as a contract between consenting parties, granted the right to sue for divorce under certain circumstances, and regulated polygyny. It also allowed men to have sexual relations with consenting female slaves, but only under the condition that any children born of these unions were free, as was the mother once her owner died.</p>
               <p class="subtitle">What similarities and differences can you identify in the spread of Islam to India, Anatolia, West Africa, and Spain? </p>
               <p>• Islam spread to India, Anatolia, and Spain in part through force of arms of Islamic armies, while Islam arrived in West Africa with Muslim traders.
                  • Sufis facilitated conversions by accommodating local traditions, especially in India and Anatolia, but played a smaller role in West Africa until at least the eighteenth century.
                  • In India, West Africa, and Spain, Islam became one of several faiths within the wider culture, while in Anatolia it became the dominant faith. 
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle"> In what ways was Anatolia changed by its incorporation into the Islamic world?</p>
               <p> • A vast majority of the population converted to Islam from Christianity.
                  • Turkish conquerors also brought cultural transformation. The Turkish language predominated. Some Sufi religious practices derived from Central AsianTurkicshamanismtookroot.Turkictraditionsof a freer more gender-equal life for women persisted.
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle">What makes it possible to speak of the Islamic world as a distinct and coherent civilization? </p>
               <p>• At the core of that civilization was a common commitment to Islam.
                  • No group was more important in the transmission of Islamic beliefs and practices than the ulama, an "international elite" who created a system of education that served to bind together an immense and diverse civilization.
                  • The Sufi religious orders established an educational network and organized a variety of larger associations, some of which included chapters throughout the Islamic world.
                  • The pilgrimage to Mecca (the hajj) drew many thousands of Muslims to Mecca each year from all over the Islamic world.
                  • The Islamic world also cohered as an immense arena of exchange in which goods, technologies, food products, and ideas circulated widely. 
               </p>
               <p class="subtitle">In what ways was the world of Islam a "cosmopolitan civilization"? </p>
               <p> • The Islamic world valued commerce and fostered vibrant networks of exchange. Muslim merchants plied the Silk Roads, Sea Roads, and Sand Roads of the Afro-Eurasian world, and the Islamic world promoted long-distance economic relationships by actively supporting a prosperous, highly developed, "capitalist" economy.
                  • Islamic civilization also facilitated a substantial exchange of agricultural products andpractices. Rice, new strains of sorghum, hard wheat, bananas, lemons, limes, watermelons, coconut palms, spinach, artichokes, sugarcane, and cotton came to the Middle East from India. Sugarcane and cotton also came with knowledge of complex production processes. Some of these Indian crops subsequently found their way to Africa and Europe from the Middle East.
                  • Technology also diffused widely within the Islamic world. Ancient Persian techniques for obtaining water by drilling into the sides of hills spread to North Africa. Muslim technicians made improvements on rockets developed in China. Techniques for manufacturing paper also arrived in the Middle East from China and later spread from the Middle East to India and Europe.
                  • Ideas also spread, with Jewish and Christian precedents influencing Islamic thinkers; Persian bureaucratic practice, court ritual, and poetry influencing the elite in particular; and Greek and Indian scientific, medical, and philosophical texts being systematically translated into Arabic and studied throughout the Islamic world.
                  • Those traditions mixed and blended to generate a distinctive Islamic civilization that made many original contributions to the world of learning—including the development of algebra as a novel mathematical discipline, original work in astronomy and optics, and medicine and pharmacology.
